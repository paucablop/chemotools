## __What's new? 🎉🎉__

## __Improvements ✨✨__

## __Bug fixes 🐛🐛__
- RangeCut now has a different input order: start, end and wavenumber (optional). Optional inputs are defined at the end. start and end index are found after fitting the method and not upon instantiation. This is because in scikitlearn, instanciation attributes cannot be modified.

- ConstantCorrection: Same changes as RangeCut
