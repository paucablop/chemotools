# __Welcome to chemotools 🖖__

This project is an implementation of spectral preprocessing techniques integrated with the widely popular sklearn API, providing you with an easy-to-use toolkit for analyzing and manipulating your data. With this integration, you can easily apply techniques such as spectral derivative, scatter correction or baseline removal to your datasets.

🎯 The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly package for spectral preprocessing, with a focus on making it accessible to a wide range of users, from data scientists to researchers to curious learners. By integrating these techniques with the powerful sklearn API, I intend to enable users to easily build and deploy machine learning and chemometric models on top of preprocessed data, making it possible to identify patterns and make predictions with greater accuracy.


📝 In addition, I take great care to ensure that all functions are thoroughly unit tested for both API compatibility and functionality. I believe that unit testing is an essential part of any software development process, and it is particularly important for a project like this, which aims to provide reliable data analysis tools. I hope that this project will serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about spectral preprocessing and machine learning.

🚀 In this repository, you will find a range of tools and resources for using spectral preprocessing techniques with the sklearn API, including code samples, documentation, and examples. I encourage contributions from the community, whether through bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests, to help us make this project even better.

👍 Thank you for your interest in this project, and I hope you find it useful for your data analysis and machine learning needs.
