# Contributing to Chemotools

Chemotools is a project designed for production code, focusing on maintaining high-quality standards. Please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing:

## Project Functionality

- **Scikit-Learn API Implementation:** All functions within Chemotools must implement the Scikit-Learn API for consistency and interoperability.

- **Avoiding Redundancy:** Functions that are already present in other libraries implementing the Scikit-Learn API should not be implemented in Chemotools to prevent redundancy.

- **Unit Testing:** Every function in Chemotools must be accompanied by thorough unit tests. This ensures the reliability and robustness of the codebase.

We welcome your contributions and appreciate your commitment to maintaining the quality of Chemotools. Please follow the guidelines outlined below to ensure a smooth and effective contribution process.
