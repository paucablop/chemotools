    abstract = {Abstract Operating lignocellulosic fermentation processes to produce fuels and chemicals is challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of the fermentation media. Real-time monitoring is necessary to compensate for these challenges, but the traditional process monitoring methods fail to deliver actionable information that can be used to implement advanced control strategies. In this study, a hybrid-modeling approach is presented to monitor cellulose-to-ethanol (EtOH) fermentations in real-time. The hybrid approach uses a continuous-discrete extended Kalman filter to reconciliate the predictions of a data-driven model and a kinetic model and to estimate the concentration of glucose (Glu), xylose (Xyl), and EtOH. The data-driven model is based on partial least squares (PLS) regression and predicts in real-time the concentration of Glu, Xyl, and EtOH from spectra collected with attenuated total reflectance mid-infrared spectroscopy. The estimations made by the hybrid approach, the data-driven models and the internal model were compared in two validation experiments showing that the hybrid model significantly outperformed the PLS and improved the predictions of the internal model. Furthermore, the hybrid model delivered consistent estimates even when disturbances in the measurements occurred, demonstrating the robustness of the method. The consistency of the proposed hybrid model opens the doors towards the implementation of advanced feedback control schemes.},

abstract = {Pre-processing of near-infrared (NIR) spectral data has become an integral part of chemometrics modeling. The objective of the pre-processing is to remove physical phenomena in the spectra in order to improve the subsequent multivariate regression, classification model or exploratory analysis. The most widely used pre-processing techniques can be divided into two categories: scatter-correction methods and spectral derivatives. This review describes and compares the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of current pre-processing methods plus the qualitative and quantitative consequences of their application. The aim is to provide NIR users with better end-models through fundamental knowledge on spectral pre-processing.}

abstract = {Data generated by analytical instruments, such as spectrometers, may contain unwanted variation due to measurement mode, sample state and other external physical, chemical and environmental factors. Preprocessing is required so that the property of interest can be predicted correctly. Different correction methods may remove specific types of artefacts while still leaving some effects behind. Using multiple preprocessing in a complementary way can remove the artefacts that would be left behind by using only one technique. This article summarizes the recent developments in new data preprocessing strategies and specifically reviews the emerging ensemble approaches to preprocessing fusion in chemometrics. A demonstration case is also presented. In summary, ensemble preprocessing allows the selection of several techniques and their combinations that, in a complementary way, lead to improved models. Ensemble approaches are not limited to spectral data but can be used in all cases where preprocessing is needed and identification of a single best option is not easily done.}
